## Downloading and installing Chemwindows 6.0
 
Chemwindows 6.0 is available as a compressed file with the extension .rar. You can download it from various online sources, such as [ChemVN](https://chemvn.org/t/chemwin-6-0/2062) [^2^] or [Microsoft Sway](https://sway.office.com/QmZEIPfbcK7SpyBx) [^4^]. However, be careful of potential viruses or malware that may come with the file.
 
To open the .rar file, you will need a program that can extract compressed files, such as WinRAR or 7-Zip. After extracting the file, you will find a folder named ChemWindow 6. Inside the folder, there is a file named CW6.exe. This is the executable file that runs Chemwindows 6.0. You do not need to install anything else.
 
## Using Chemwindows 6.0 to draw chemical structures
 
To start Chemwindows 6.0, double-click on the CW6.exe file. You will see a window like this:

To draw a chemical structure, you can use the mouse or the keyboard to select and place atoms and bonds on the drawing area. For example, to draw methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), you can follow these steps:
 
1. Select the carbon atom tool from the toolbar or press C on the keyboard.
2. Click on the drawing area where you want to place the carbon atom.
3. Select the single bond tool from the toolbar or press S on the keyboard.
4. Click on the carbon atom and drag the mouse in any direction to draw a bond.
5. Release the mouse button when you see a hydrogen atom appear at the end of the bond.
6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 three more times to draw three more bonds and hydrogen atoms around the carbon atom.

You should see something like this:

You can use similar methods to draw other organic molecules, such as ethane (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>), benzene (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub>), glucose (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>), etc. You can also use shortcuts and templates to speed up your drawing process. For example, to draw benzene, you can use the ring tool or press R on the keyboard and select the six-membered ring with alternating double bonds from the menu. Then click on the drawing area where you want to place the ring and you will see this:
