For this example, we will choose "Standard (in).ipt" as the project type. This means that we will create a part file using inches as the unit of measurement.
 
Click on "Create" to open a new part file in X-Force Inventor 2018. You will see the main interface of the software, which consists of several panels and toolbars. On the left side of the screen, you will see the browser panel, which shows the structure and features of your part file. On the right side of the screen, you will see the properties panel, which shows the properties and parameters of your part file. On the top of the screen, you will see the ribbon toolbar, which contains various commands and tools for creating and modifying your part file. On the bottom of the screen, you will see the status bar, which shows some information and messages about your part file.
 
## Step 3: Sketch the Basic Shape of Your Car
 
The first step in creating a 3D model is to sketch its basic shape on a plane. To do this, you need to use the sketch tools in X-Force Inventor 2018. You can access these tools from the "Sketch" tab on the ribbon toolbar.
 
To start a new sketch, click on the "Create 2D Sketch" button on the "Sketch" tab. You will see a dialog box that lets you choose a plane or face to sketch on. For this example, we will choose the XY plane as our sketch plane.
