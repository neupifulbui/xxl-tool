# Review: TropicalSim Porto LPPR 2014 for FSX and P3D
 
Porto is the second-largest city in Portugal and a popular tourist destination. It is also home to Francisco SÃ¡ Carneiro Airport (LPPR), which serves as a hub for TAP Air Portugal and Ryanair. TropicalSim has released an updated version of their scenery for this airport, compatible with both FSX and P3D. In this review, we will take a look at the features and performance of this add-on.
 
## Installation and Configuration
 
The installation process is straightforward and requires a valid serial number. The installer will detect your simulator version and install the scenery accordingly. You can also choose to install static aircraft, SODE jetways, and dynamic lighting (for P3D v4 only). The scenery comes with a configuration tool that allows you to adjust some options, such as the level of detail, the ground textures, and the 3D grass.

## Scenery Features
 
The scenery covers the entire airport area, as well as some surrounding buildings and landmarks. The airport layout is accurate and up-to-date, with all the runways, taxiways, aprons, and terminals. The terminal buildings are well modeled and textured, with transparent windows and interior details. The jetways are animated and can be controlled by SODE or the default system. The ground textures are high-resolution and show realistic wear and tear. The 3D grass adds some depth and realism to the scenery. The airport also has custom night lighting, which looks great in P3D v4 with dynamic lighting enabled.
 
The scenery also includes some static aircraft, such as TAP Air Portugal A320s and Ryanair 737s. These add some life to the airport, but they can be disabled if you prefer. The scenery also features some custom sounds, such as the announcements and the wind turbines. The surrounding area has some landmarks, such as the bridges, the stadium, and the city center. These are not very detailed, but they help to create a sense of location and orientation.
 
## Performance
 
The scenery is well optimized and does not have a significant impact on the frame rates or the VAS usage. I tested it on a mid-range system with FSX:SE and P3D v4.5, and I did not experience any stutters or crashes. The scenery is compatible with other add-ons, such as ORBX Global and Vector, as well as AI traffic programs. The scenery also works well with different weather conditions and seasons.
 
## Conclusion
 
TropicalSim Porto LPPR 2014 is a solid scenery for FSX and P3D users who want to fly to or from this Portuguese airport. It offers a realistic representation of the airport and its surroundings, with good modeling, texturing, lighting, and sound effects. It is also easy to install and configure, and does not affect the performance too much. The scenery is available for $23.90 USD from SimMarket.com.
