# Ikegai TU 15: A Universal Type CNC Turning Machine
 
Ikegai TU 15 is a CNC lathe that can handle various machining tasks with high precision and efficiency. It is a universal type machine that can perform turning, facing, drilling, tapping, and other operations on different materials and shapes. It has a highly rigid 4-way bed, a main axis diameter of 150 mm, and a 4-speed CVT that can rotate from 3 to 2000 rpm. It also has a slant-bed with a 45 degrees angle that ensures excellent chip removal and a double door that provides good operability with a wide workspace.
 
The Ikegai TU 15 operates under a program made up of a series of instructions called G-codes. Each program consists of a sequence of words, each of which is the code for one operation or parameter. The program can be created using a computer-aided design (CAD) software or manually entered using the machine's control panel. The program can be stored in the machine's memory or on an external device such as a USB flash drive.

The Ikegai TU 15 programming manual is a document that explains how to create and execute programs for the machine. It covers the basic concepts of CNC programming, the functions and features of the machine's control system, the format and meaning of G-codes, and some examples of programs for common machining tasks. The manual also provides troubleshooting tips and safety precautions for operating the machine.
 
The Ikegai TU 15 programming manual is a valuable resource for anyone who wants to learn how to use this versatile CNC lathe. It can help users to optimize their machining processes, improve their productivity and quality, and expand their machining capabilities.
  
One of the advantages of the Ikegai TU 15 is its user-friendly control system. It has a 10.4-inch color LCD display that shows the program, the status, and the settings of the machine. It also has a keyboard, a mouse, and a touch panel that allow users to input and edit programs easily. The control system supports various languages, such as English, Japanese, Chinese, and Korean. It also has a network interface that enables users to connect the machine to a computer or a network.
 
Another advantage of the Ikegai TU 15 is its high-performance spindle and turret. The spindle is equipped with a high-torque motor that delivers powerful cutting force and smooth rotation. The spindle can also accommodate various types of chucks and tools, such as hydraulic chucks, collet chucks, and live tools. The turret is a 12-station type that can hold up to 24 tools. The turret can perform indexing and tool change in a short time, reducing the non-cutting time and increasing the efficiency.
